# Overview of mass balance satellite Earth Observation (EO) techniques

The are three main geodetic technologies (`satellite geodesy') to measure ice mass balance:
- gravimetry (gravitational mass balance)
    - GRACE(-FO) are the main source of measurment.
    - relies heavily on GIA (glacial isostratic adjusments) to disentangle variance in the gravity field due to mass balance and solid earth effects like the rebound (uncertainty)
- altimetry (altimetry mass balance) 
    - radar altimetry (older)
    - laser altimetry (newer) 
    - estimate mass change via volume change (most uncertainty from converting volume to mass as it relies on density models of ice and firn)
    - minor GIA adjustment
    - resolved spatial detail
- input-output (relies on interferometry (InSAR))

- Various satellite methods differ in their strengths and wekanesses.

# Data

# gmb data

Various Level-3 (gridded) data products are published by JPL, GFZ and CSR, which are all based on the identical raw GRACE(-FO) Level-1 satellite observations. See the [GRACE Tellus website](https://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/data/choosing-a-solution/) for more details. The largest categorical difference among data sets is between mascon (mass concentration) solutions and spherical harmonics kernels.

[COST-G gridded data via GFZ](https://gravis.gfz-potsdam.de/ais) This is a combination product combining multiple L2 data including GFZ. The spatial resolution is 50km x 50km. Gravitational mass balance change is reported in kg/m^2 relative to the long-term average from 2002-04 to 2020-03, to reduce the effect of noise or seasonal patterns that might impact any single time slice (i.e. field). RL stands for release.

[JPL RL06.1_v03 monthly mass grid mascons](https://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/data/get-data/jpl_global_mascons/) This is the latest JPL product on 0.5 degrees resolution (50 km). View [here](https://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/data/data-analysis-tool/). Download data (netcdf) via [PODAAC](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/TELLUS_GRAC-GRFO_MASCON_CRI_GRID_RL06.1_V3). Uncertainty estimates are provided.

[Copernicus gmb](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/10.24381/cds.38b9366c?tab=overview) This appears to not be gridded data, but basin-level data according to [this documentation](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=355348674).

## Visualisations

[NASA visualisation](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/31158/):

This animation shows **gravitational mass balance (gmb)** of the AIS (Antarctic ice sheet) over time. Note: This visualisation is relative to 2012, i.e. the cumulative mass loss/mass gain is presented. The line plot on the left shows gigatonnes [gt] and the visualisation on the right shows meters water equivalent. The data also originates from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) twin satellites and GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO) twin satellites, but processes by JPL. A mass loss of 142 gt/year is reported. The visualisation is based on a JPL GRACE (MASCON CRI GRID RL06.1 V3).

[GFZ/COST-G visualisation](https://gravis.gfz-potsdam.de/ais)

This animation also shows **gravitational mass balance (gmb)** of the AIS (Antarctic ice sheet) over time. The lineplot at the bottom shows gigatonnes [gt] and the visualisation at the top shows kg/m^2 which is equvalent to mm water equivalent. Total mass loss is slighlty more conservative than that reported by NASA, approx 99 gt loss/year.

# Next steps
- Interpolate data to generate more time stamps.
- 

# DeepSensor Questions
- Can we change the initialisation (prior) of the covariances?
- What is the unit of the receptive field? Is the size relative to 1x1?
- Why can we not preprocess Datasets with only the time dimension?
- When processing a dataset with multiple variables, does the normalisation method need to be consistent? No.

# Solved issues
- nan's in target: 
    - see https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/deepsensor/user-guide/task_loader.html
    - add to generate function?
    - Wasn't clear to me
- produce MWC (Minimum workable code)

# ToDo:
- Convert off-grid back to grid for prediction vis
- Add other context inputs
- Active learning 2 objectives: minimise gap between 2 methods (gmb and altimetry), select methods to maximise explainatory power
- train on both data sets.
- push to new Git repo because of issue
- bed topo ablation
- year ablation
- fine tuning
- other off-diagonal initialisation

# Research ideas:
- pure KL divergence approach:
- how do we combine the notion of uncertainty and general aqcuition functions with that of KL
- KL * high mass loss
