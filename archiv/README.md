# Data

Gravitational mass balance (gmb) data of Antarctica's ice sheet: [NASA visualisation](https://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/resources/31/antarctic-ice-loss-2002-2020/). Note: This visualisation is relative to 2012, i.e. the cumulative mass loss is presented.

# DeepSensor Questions
- What is the unit of the receptive field? Is the size relative to 1x1?
- Does the preprocessing work on xarray.Datasets and xarray.Dataarrays? Yes.
- Why can we not preprocess Datasets with only the time dimension?
- When processing a dataset with multiple variables, does the normalisation method need to be consistent? No.

# Solved issues
- nan's in target: 
    - see https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/deepsensor/user-guide/task_loader.html
    - add to generate function?
    - Wasn't clear to me
- produce MWC (Minimum workable code)

# ToDo:
- Convert off-grid back to grid for prediction vis
- Add other context inputs
- Active learning 2 objectives: minimise gap between 2 methods (gmb and altimetry), select methods to maximise explainatory power
- train on both data sets.
- push to new Git repo because of issue
